        <h2>RPGs</h2>
        <p>RPGs is a very wide genre of games That can describe a wide variety of games. An RPG or Role Playing Game can describe most games but to me as a genre it is a facinating one.</p>
        <p>To me and RPG is a game where you the player put yourself in place of the character you play as whether you made that character or it is a character made by the developers you put yourself in their shoes and experience rhe world they live in and immerse yourself exploring a new land.</p>
