        <h2>Racing Games</h2>
        <p>There is are many Different kinds of racing games, from hyper realistic sims to, casual arcade ones. This genre comes last in my Top generes as I am not a large fan of the realistic racing sim side of the game.</p>
        <p>I more prefer the Arcade side of the game. In particular my favorite series and main games I play in the genre is Trackmania, A series made by Nadeo(<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/nadeo">https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/nadeo)</a>. Nadeo made the first Trackmania game in 2003 and have been consistently releasing new games in the series with the newest Game 'Trackmaina' called by the community Trackmania(2020) getting 25 new tracks every 3 months plus hundreds of comminuty made maps every day. </p>

                <img id="TMT" src="images/TMT.png" alt="8 cars driving up a veritcal twisted race track">
                <p>Trackmania Turbo Released on 24th of March 2016 on console and PC was a large step up from the previous game including 4 different vehicle types and 200 tracks of increasing difficulty. The game also released with a Track editor for community members to make their own tracks.</p>
                <p>Trackmania as a series is about driving the fastest time possible on a Track and depending on how fast you can get a rating of on the Track from Bronze, Silver, Gold, and TrackMaster. Around 2 years after the game was released Nadeo invited Top community members to set the fastest Time possible and using their times to introduce new ratings above the previous ones, these were Super Bronze, Super Silver, Super Gold, and Super Trackmaster. The times set for these Ratings and extremely hard to to beat as they are nearly perfect run on those tracks.</p>

                <img id="TM2020" src="images/trackmania_big.png" alt="3 cars in mid air jumping through a loop">
                <p>Trackmania or Trackmania(2020) was released on May 5th 2020 on PC and May 15th 2023 on Console. The game released with one vehicle type and 25 Tracks but from constant updates there is currently 4 different vehicle types and 500 campaign tracks to play through.</p>
                <p>Just like the previous game in the series TMTurbo the objective is getting the fastest time on the track. The ratings in this game are Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Author. Author Medal is the fastest time that the developers of the game have set on that track. TM(2020) just like Turbo has an in game track editor with many more features than in Turbo allowing for Beautiful and crative tracks to be made. Nadeo even host a daily tournament called Track of the Day and select a community made map to add to the game. So with the maps made by Nadeo and the community made maps added by them there is well over 1000 track in the game.</p>
